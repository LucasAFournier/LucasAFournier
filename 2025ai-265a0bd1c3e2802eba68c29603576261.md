# Applied AI in an Enterprise Context


## Abstract


This report details a pilot project for deploying conversational AI agents in an enterprise setting. The objectives were to: (i) establish a secure platform for experimentation, (ii) prototype two use-cases—commercial prospecting and administrative assistance, and (iii) develop an evaluation and governance framework for future scaling. The pilot used a self-hosted interface for large language models, a minimal retrieval pipeline, and standard authentication protocols. The focus was on user adoption, measurable productivity signals, and compliance-aware practices. Key outcomes include operational templates for A/B and interrupted time-series (ITS) evaluations, a compliant prospecting workflow, and a repeatable deployment pattern for rapid iteration.


## Introduction


Enterprises seek efficient, low-risk methods to integrate Artificial Intelligence (AI) without incurring long-term technical debt. This pilot prioritized high-ROI use-cases and focused on measuring adoption and productivity. To lower the barrier to entry, we used a familiar chat interface. A core tenet was that technology adoption requires clear benefits for users. Consequently, success criteria included not only technical performance but also employee uptake, observable efficiency gains, and the generation of insights to guide a future enterprise-wide rollout.


## State of the Art in Enterprise AI Agents


### Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Factual Grounding


A key technique in conversational AI is **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)**, which grounds model outputs in factual information. RAG systems combine a large language model (LLM) with a document retriever, giving the model access to current, authoritative data and providing users with the sources for each answer [@lewis2020rag]. By conditioning responses on external knowledge (e.g., a corporate database or internal wiki), RAG reduces hallucinations and improves accuracy. This approach makes the LLM more transparent and trustworthy by enabling source attribution and traceability [@rag-practitioner-2024] [@facts-benchmark-2024]. In an enterprise context, grounding answers on trusted data ensures outputs are verified and consistent. A key operational benefit is that knowledge can be updated by refreshing the document index without retraining the model [@rag-primer-2024]. RAG has become the standard method for aligning conversational agents with factual ground truth [@lewis2020rag] [@rag-practitioner-2024] [@facts-benchmark-2024].


### Tool-Augmented Agents and Function Calling


**Tool augmentation** extends agent capabilities beyond text generation, allowing them to interact with external systems. This is achieved by having the model generate structured output, such as API calls or code, that a runtime can execute to perform actions or retrieve information [@react-yao-2023] [@toolformer-schick-2023] [@openai-function-calling-2023]. For example, an agent might call a search function to query a knowledge base. Lightweight protocols and schemas standardize these interactions, allowing tool results to be fed back into the dialogue coherently. As agents become more capable through RAG and tool use, rigorous performance assessment becomes critical.


### Evaluation in Applied AI Deployments


Evaluating conversational agents in practice requires methods beyond standard NLP benchmarks. Enterprise AI teams are adopting **evaluation frameworks** that combine offline metrics with online experiments to measure performance and business impact. **A/B testing** is a common practice to measure the causal effects of a new AI agent on key metrics like task completion time or user satisfaction when compared to a control group [@enterprise-nlp-patterns-2024].


In addition, practitioners use **iterative and human-in-the-loop evaluations** to refine agent behavior. This involves analyzing dialogue transcripts and having annotators label errors (e.g., factual mistakes, irrelevant answers) to track improvements across system versions [@enterprise-nlp-patterns-2024]. There is also growing interest in **simulation-based evaluation**, where LLM-driven agents simulate user interactions in a sandbox environment to test an AI agent’s responses at scale before deployment [@simulated-users-2023]. While academic benchmarks for grounded dialogue exist [@facts-benchmark-2024], enterprise evaluation is highly contextual, often requiring custom success criteria. A robust evaluation strategy therefore mixes quantitative and qualitative methods: offline tests, user studies, and controlled online trials [@enterprise-nlp-patterns-2024] [@llm-as-judge-2023] [@bayesian-eval-2024].


### Secure Deployment and Identity Governance


In enterprise environments, **security, compliance, and identity governance** are paramount. Unlike public chatbots, enterprise agents handle sensitive data and must adhere to organizational policies. State-of-the-art deployments are often self-hosted or VPC-contained to ensure data remains within a controlled environment [@librechat-docs] [@ai-gateway-2024]. These platforms typically integrate **single sign-on (SSO)** and role-based access control, so that only authenticated employees can use the agent [@librechat-docs] [@ai-gateway-2024].


This identity-centric approach is critical, as agents may interface with internal systems on a user’s behalf. A key challenge is enforcing the principle of **least privilege**, as a general-purpose agent might require broad access, creating a risk of over-permissioning [@owasp-llm-2023]. To mitigate this, organizations are exploring governance frameworks that map AI actions to human approvals and audit trails. For instance, an agent might be permitted to read documents but require human confirmation to modify data.


Ultimately, the success of an enterprise AI agent depends on **trust, transparency, and controllability**. Enterprises often favor reliable, instruction-following models over more “creative” but unpredictable ones. Grounding and auditability provide the “confidence layer” for enterprise investment [@confidence-layer-2024]. The state of the art is thus defined less by novel model architectures and more by **system design**: integrating proven LLMs with appropriate retrieval, tools, and guardrails to meet organizational requirements for traceability, security, and compliance [@rag-practitioner-2024] [@facts-benchmark-2024] [@confidence-layer-2024].


## Pilot Design and Implementation


This section outlines the rationale, architecture, and use-cases developed during the pilot. Figure 1 illustrates the strategic landscape of enterprise AI deployment, mapping requirements, options, challenges, and solutions. Our pilot represents a deliberate path through this space, prioritizing security, rapid learning, and institutional alignment.

### A Maturity Model for Enterprise AI Adoption


To contextualize our approach, we map AI use-cases onto a maturity model that balances business value against implementation complexity and risk (Figure 2). The model outlines three profiles, progressing from low-risk exploration to high-stakes automation. Each stage introduces new data sensitivities and operational risks, demanding more sophisticated governance and security. Our pilot was scoped to the first two stages—“Explore & Ideate” and “Analyze & Visualize”—to build foundational capabilities in a controlled manner.

**Figure 2:** A maturity model for enterprise AI adoption, categorizing usage profiles by increasing complexity and risk. Each profile details the purpose, representative tasks, and the corresponding governance and platform implications.


To implement this model, we designed a modular enterprise stack (Figure 3). The architecture maps components to the three usage profiles, separating the user interface from data and automation layers to create clear security boundaries. The green zone (“Explore & Ideate”) provides a low-risk environment for general tasks. The orange zone (“Analyze & Visualize”) introduces secure, mediated access to enterprise data. The red zone (“Automate & Delegate”) supports governed workflows for performing actions on behalf of the user. This layered design allows for progressive capability introduction as organizational trust and technical maturity grow.

The architecture is zoned by usage profile: Green (Explore & Ideate) for basic chat; Orange (Analyze & Visualize) for secure data analysis; and Red (Automate & Delegate) for governed workflow execution. The design emphasizes security and governance by separating the user-facing chat layer from backend data and automation systems via a dedicated Model Context Protocol (MCP) server.


### Rationale and Architecture


Our architecture was designed for security, modularity, and institutional alignment.


**Platform Choice.** We selected an open-source, model-agnostic front-end to provide a familiar chat experience, easing user adoption and avoiding vendor lock-in.


**Data-Aware Agents.** To ensure reliability and traceability, agents were connected to organizational and public data via a minimal RAG implementation and a tool-access protocol.


**Deployment Pattern.** The platform was self-hosted on a single workstation using containerization and a reverse proxy. This posture minimized operational overhead for the pilot.


### Governance and Operations


**Access and Identity.** User access was managed through a standard OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider to enforce enterprise authentication.


**Monitoring.** Basic usage and performance metrics were collected for trend analysis.


**Provider Flexibility.** The architecture was designed to be model-agnostic, allowing for migration to other providers to meet future requirements.


### Use-Cases


### Commercial Prospecting


We implemented a prospecting workflow from company profiling to outreach drafting. A bespoke tool, **`mcp-recherche-entreprises`**, provided authoritative company data from the French SIRENE (INSEE) register. This data was used to ground subsequent steps, and outreach content followed controlled templates.


### Administrative Assistance


A documentation-aligned agent answered questions on internal protocols (e.g., HR, finance), providing citations and refusing to answer when confidence was low. The retrieval layer was intentionally minimal to prioritize clear governance and source traceability.


## Evaluation and Discussion


### Evaluation Framework


We designed an evaluation framework using **controlled A/B tests** and **interrupted time-series (ITS)** analysis to measure changes in key metrics. Quantitative KPIs included latency, factuality, cost per interaction, and escalation rates. These were supplemented by qualitative feedback on usefulness and clarity. Table 1 provides an example of the intended measurement approach using synthetic data.


| KPI                        | Baseline (Control) | Variant (Agent) | Absolute Gain | Relative Gain |
| -------------------------- | ------------------ | --------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| **P95 Latency (ms)**       | 9,000              | 6,000           | **−3,000 ms** | **−33%**      |
| **Cost/Conversation (€)**  | 0.11               | 0.07            | **−0.04 €**   | **−36%**      |
| **Factual Accuracy (%)**   | 84                 | 92              | **+8 pts**    | **+9.5%**     |
| **User Satisfaction (/5)** | 3.9                | 4.4             | **+0.5**      | **+12.8%**    |


**Table 1:** Illustrative KPI Results — Synthetic Example.


The illustrative numbers are based on the following rationale:
* **Latency:** Assumes short business replies (≈150–200 output tokens) on frontier APIs. The improvement (9.0s → 6.0s) reflects optimizations like prompt compression and caching.
* **Cost:** A conversation is modeled as ≈12k input + 6k output tokens. The cost reduction (€0.11 → €0.07) is attributed to prompt engineering and lighter retrieval.
* **Accuracy:** Assumes a weekly human audit. The 8-point uplift (84% → 92%) is a plausible outcome of using RAG.
* **Satisfaction:** The +0.5 point gain (3.9 → 4.4) is consistent with reported CSAT improvements in similar AI projects.


### Results and Discussion


The pilot produced three key artifacts: (1) a repeatable, self-hosted deployment with enterprise SSO; (2) a prospecting workflow grounded in authoritative data; and (3) an administrative agent with citation capabilities. These outcomes reduced the barrier for future experiments and established a shared measurement baseline.


The primary value of the pilot was not model performance but **operational evidence**. We demonstrated the ability to deploy safe, explainable agents quickly, facilitate user adoption, and measure their impact. By prioritizing standard identity protocols, minimal retrieval, and protocolized tool access, the pilot favored institutional learning and portability over bespoke engineering. This approach acknowledges that a deliberate adoption strategy is necessary to demonstrate value and drive sustained engagement.


The pilot’s scope was intentionally limited. The single-host deployment is not a production-ready target state. Data retention automation and disaster recovery were not implemented. Scalability and rate-limit management were considered in the design but not stress-tested.


## Conclusion and Perspectives


This pilot validated a security-first approach to integrating conversational AI in an enterprise context. The primary contribution is not a novel model architecture but an operational blueprint for deploying trustworthy AI agents. By prioritizing identity management and auditable data grounding via RAG and tool protocols, the project established a repeatable pattern for secure experimentation and a framework for measuring business impact.


The work demonstrates that successful enterprise AI adoption hinges on institutional trust and capability, not solely on technological novelty. The focus on governance, traceability, and controlled evaluation (A/B, ITS) provided the necessary assurance for moving beyond speculative trials. The tangible outcomes—a secure self-hosted platform, a compliant prospecting workflow, and a citation-capable administrative agent—serve as evidence that productivity gains can be achieved within enterprise security and compliance constraints.


From a research perspective, this study’s deployment pattern and zoned architecture (Figure 3) offer a scaffold for navigating the proposed AI maturity model (Figure 2). A logical extension would be to apply the governance framework to the “Analyze & Visualize” profile, addressing the challenges of connecting agents to sensitive internal data sources. Further research could focus on standardizing the A/B and ITS evaluation methods into a robust, repeatable methodology. The final maturity stage, “Automate & Delegate,” presents a significant research challenge in developing governance protocols for agents that execute actions with auditable user consent. In conclusion, this pilot provides a foundational, evidence-based strategy that can serve as a template for future applied research in secure and transparent AI integration within enterprises.
